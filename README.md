#Hulkster

Hulkster is a tool (command line + node) to compile [hogan.js](http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js/) templates. Hogan.js has a similar tool named "hulk", but it is too simple to meet the majority of use cases. So hulkster is a kind of super "hulk".

### Use wildcards

Thanks to [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob), it's possible to use wildcards in files.

## Use in node

````javascript
var hulkster = require('hulkster');

hulkster.compile('template.mustache', {
	minify: 'true'
});
````

###hulkster.compile(files, options)

* `files` can be a `string` or an `array` of files.
* `options` is an `object` that accepts options defined in usage (with camel syntax).

As in command line, it's possible to use wildcards.
